# Class-Activity-1
For this activity, I mainly focused on the placement of constraints for each new item added to the app. For example like the title of the app and the search bar would make sense to be constrained to the top of the app and their respective sides (left and right). Then the bottom button would be constained across the bottom and sides. As for the content in the middle of the activity it was important to use the consistent constraints for their sides. Like the checkboxes it was important to have a left side constraint rather than a right side because if you were to use the right then the size of the text would determine where the box would be placed in the screen and this is not what we want. Therefore, for this case, it was better to have a left constraint so they would remain uniform despite their text. Similarly, the other boxes I had a hortizontal constraint to one another to specify the amount of space that was between one another to give this look of uniformity.
